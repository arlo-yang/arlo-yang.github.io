I am a senior undergraduate student at The University of Edinburgh, where I am honored to be supervised by [Prof. Changjian Li](https://enigma-li.github.io/). Previously, I completed a summer research project on continual learning under the guidance of [Prof. Huiping Zhuang](https://zhuanghp.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.

During my junior year, I was selected as an exchange student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I had the privilege of attending courses by [Prof. Tan Bui-Thanh](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~tanbui/) (ML), [Prof. Zhangyang “Atlas” Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/research.html) (CV), and [Prof. Louis Gutierrez](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=595) (XAI). Their exceptional teaching and encouragement greatly inspired my commitment to pursuing research in AI.
